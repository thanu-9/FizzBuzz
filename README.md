## Changes made and Outcome from the changes
<dd> When I initially run the code I received the following results:
1, FizzBuzz, 3, 4, FizzBuzz, 6, FizzBuzz, FizzBuzz, 9, 10, FizzBuzz, FizzBuzz, 13, FizzBuzz, 15, 16, FizzBuzz, 18, 19, FizzBuzz, 21, FizzBuzz, FizzBuzz, 24, 25, FizzBuzz... </dd>
### Change 1:
In the FizzBuzzGenerator.java the 'divisibleBy' returns 2 but instead I returned 0.
the results I received is:
<dd> [1, 2, FizzBuzz, 4, FizzBuzz, FizzBuzz, 7, 8, FizzBuzz, FizzBuzz, 11, FizzBuzz, 13, 14, FizzBuzz, 16, 17, FizzBuzz, 19, FizzBuzz, FizzBuzz, 22, 23, FizzBuzz, FizzBuzz... </dd>
